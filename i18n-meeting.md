# Marketplace I18n Meeting

## In meeting

### Quick Alignment

- Needed to get aligned on full scope of H2, we're almost there
- In order to accelerate things, we need to agree on scope and build
- In parallel to DEV work for H2, PM will be uncovering a backlog of L10n items that will be actioned in Q1
- Newly discovered items will fall into Phase 2 work by definition

### High level timelines

- Are we shooting for Phase 1 (I18n) on 1/1?
- Are we shooting for Phase 2 (L10n for country 2) on 3/31?

### What we're building in Phase 1

- Items marked “I” in columns C and F in the spreadsheet
  - Discuss blue items

## Action Items

- Justin to work with Mike B on Gantting Phase 1
  - ENG to determine if another contractor could accelerate things

## Once we're aligned

- Meeting with Gabe and Karsten to level set (Hilary, Karla, Erich, Dan)

## Future Discussions

- Cross-app concerns
  - Erich mentioned "merging our existing in-country software (finance, reports, maps) with Marketplace and Android development".  Is this in International concern or something orthogonal
- What are the ways of working with Verticals and Horizontal ownership
  - Hilary/Erich
  - Gabe/Karsten
- As we get a clearer picture of what L10n efforts might look like, need another resourcing discussion
  - Can Erich and Kevin's team help SPIKE'ing things?
